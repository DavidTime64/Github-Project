# Github-Project
This repository is for my MAGD 150 Github Project

**Lab Assignment 1** had us practice creating shapes with p5.js.  I created a _nightime-city image_ with my programming.

**Lab Assignment 2** had us practice using colors when creating shapes.  I created multiple shapes with a **_variety of colors_**.

**Lab Assignment 3** had us practice using mouse inputs in order to create our outputs.  I used the _mouse to draw lines_, both on the cursor itself, **_as well as in other areas in relation to the cursor_**.
